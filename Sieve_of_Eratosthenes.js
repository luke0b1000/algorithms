//  Input: an integer n > 1.
 
//  Let A be an array of Boolean values, indexed by integers 2 to n,
//  initially all set to true.
 
//  for i = 2, 3, 4, ..., not exceeding âˆšn:
//    if A[i] is true:
//      for j = i2, i2+i, i2+2i, i2+3i, ..., not exceeding n:
//        A[j] := false.
 
//  Output: all i such that A[i] is true.
